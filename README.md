# Fresno State Accessibility Map
This is a student-created project intended to collect and display accessibility information from and for its users. It utilizes an interactive map for both of these purposes.

Unfortunately, the organization that this app was created for no longer exists, and as such it is not longer hosted. It may come back online in the future if I can find interested users.
