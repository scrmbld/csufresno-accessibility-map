# Fresno State Accessibility Map
This is a student-created project intended to collect and display accessibility information from and for its users. It utilizes an interactive map for both of these purposes.

Some preparation of the host machine is still needed in order to publish the website. Hopefully this will be completed some time in the next few weeks.
